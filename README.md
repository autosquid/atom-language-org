# language-orgmode package

Originally converted from [jezcope's textmate org bundle](https://github.com/jezcope/Org.tmbundle) and [Daniel Magnusson's sublime orgmode package](https://github.com/danielmagnussons/orgmode) as explained in the [ruby-atomizr](https://github.com/idleberg/ruby-atomizr).

Some effort to properly customize this package for Atom might still be needed.
